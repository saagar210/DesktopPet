# Desktop Pet

Desktop Pet is a playful desktop penguin + focus sidekick.
It floats above your windows, reacts to interactions, and turns your Pomodoro sessions into progression, coins, quests, and customization unlocks.

## Why It Is Fun

- Your penguin lives on your desktop and reacts to pats, care actions, and focus progress.
- Focus sessions reward coins and XP, which feed directly into pet growth and unlocks.
- Quests, events, and accessories keep the loop fresh without becoming noisy.
- You can theme both the app UI and your pet setup with loadouts.

## Reliability and Recovery

- Local-first data storage with schema normalization on startup
- Snapshot export/import for backup and restore
- One-click full local reset to defaults
- Diagnostics export for debugging and support workflows
- CI quality gates for frontend checks and Tauri backend/bundle checks
- Release evidence policy (manual QA run + CI gate summary in release PRs)

## Tech Stack

Built with [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app/), React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
The pet is SVG-based, and app data is stored locally on-device.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Rust toolchain (stable)
- Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS (`xcode-select --install`)

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run test:smoke
npm run test:pack-qa
npm run tauri dev
```

### Lean Dev (low disk mode)

Use this when you want to keep local disk usage down while developing:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:lean
```

What `npm run dev:lean` does:
- Starts the app with the normal `npm run tauri dev` flow.
- Redirects heavy build caches to temporary directories (Cargo target + Vite cache).
- Automatically removes temporary caches and heavy build artifacts when you exit the app.
- Prints before/after disk usage snapshots for major bloat paths.

Disk vs speed tradeoff:
- Lean mode uses less persistent disk.
- Lean mode is usually slower on next startup because caches are rebuilt.
- Normal `npm run tauri dev` keeps caches in-repo for faster repeated starts.

### Cleanup commands

Target heavy build artifacts only:

```bash
npm run clean:heavy
```

This removes:
- `dist/`
- `artifacts/`
- `src-tauri/target/`
- `node_modules/.vite/`

Full local reproducible cleanup:

```bash
npm run clean:all
```

This runs `clean:heavy` and also removes:
- `node_modules/`

## Verification

```bash
./scripts/verify.sh
```

This runs:
- `npm test`
- `npm run test:smoke`
- `npm run test:pack-qa`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run check:performance-budget`
- `npm run test:tauri-preflight`
- `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `npm run tauri build`

## Production Build

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

Build artifacts are written to `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.
