# Cuteness Style Guide

This guide defines non-negotiable visual rules for DesktopPet species and evolution assets.

## Core Rules
- Silhouette continuity:
  - Each stage must keep a recognizable base silhouette from prior stage.
  - Stage changes can add detail, not replace the character's core shape language.
- Eye ratio:
  - Eye area should stay between 10% and 22% of face area.
  - Eyes may get slightly smaller with evolution, but never become threatening.
- Angle safety:
  - Avoid sharp angles under 60 degrees in face/head outlines.
  - No aggressive spikes near eyes/mouth.
- Mouth shape:
  - Favor soft curves (smile, tiny beak, gentle neutral).
  - No fangs, grimaces, or hostile expressions in idle art.
- Palette constraints:
  - Keep base palette to 2-4 main colors + 1 accent.
  - Keep contrast readable but soft; avoid high-saturation red as dominant body color.
- Blush/highlight:
  - Include at least one soft highlight or blush cue on stage 0 and stage 1.
  - Stage 2 can reduce blush intensity but should preserve warmth cues.

## Evolution Tone Rules
- Stage 0: comforting and baby-soft.
- Stage 1: confident but still playful.
- Stage 2: magical/refined, never intimidating.

## Motion Rules
- Idle motion should feel breathable and subtle.
- Animation budget low mode must preserve cuteness with reduced amplitude and frequency.
- Celebration should be short and joyful; no flashing effects.

## Non-Distracting Constraints
- No auto-triggered large popups tied to visual evolution.
- No sudden high-contrast flashes during normal idle/working states.
- Cosmetic packs cannot force urgency, countdowns, or FOMO prompts.
