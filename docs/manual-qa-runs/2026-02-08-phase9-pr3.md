# Manual QA Run: Phase 9 PR #3

Date: February 8, 2026
Branch: `codex/phase9-calm-progression`
PR: `#3`
Tester: Local validation pass

## Scope
- Calm quest progression UX (inline feedback + anti-repeat)
- Weighted quest selection and accessory-linked progression moments
- Seasonal pack opt-in behavior and bundle apply flow
- Photo Booth v2 theme resolution

## Automated Gate Results
- PASS: `npm test`
- PASS: `npm run test:smoke`
- PASS: `npm run build`
- PASS: `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- PASS: `./scripts/verify.sh`

## Focused UX/Behavior Checks
- PASS: New Quest button shows in-flight state and blocks repeated spam clicks.
- PASS: Quiet cooldown/progress feedback remains inline-only (no popup path).
- PASS: Seasonal packs remain disabled by default.
- PASS: Enabling a seasonal pack only updates `enabledSeasonalPacks` and does not mutate notification settings.
- PASS: Applying seasonal bundle updates style/species presets and validated species list.
- PASS: Quest weighting tests confirm stage + recent progress + accessory influence.
- PASS: Photo Booth v2 picks deterministic species/loadout themes with fallback behavior.

## Calmness Regression Checks
- PASS: Notification defaults remain quiet (`toastNotificationsEnabled = false`).
- PASS: Seasonal UI copy explicitly states no timed nudges and no urgency prompts.
- PASS: Accessory quest accents are subtle and motion-gated by behavior composer.

## Outcome
No blocking issues found for Phase 9 scope. Phase 9 Iterations A, B, and C are complete.
