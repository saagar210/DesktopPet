# Manual QA Run: Phase 8 Behavior Composer (PR #2)

Date: 2026-02-08
Tester: local validation run (headless)
Branch: codex/phase8-behavior-composer
PR: https://github.com/saagar210/DesktopPet/pull/2

## Verification Evidence
- `npm test` passed (130 tests)
- `npm run test:smoke` passed
- `npm run build` passed
- `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` passed (100 tests)
- `./scripts/verify.sh` passed including Tauri bundle build

## Checklist Results

### Calmness + Non-Distraction
- PASS: app defaults remain quiet by settings defaults (`quietModeEnabled=true`, toast off).
- PASS: notification paths remain opt-in and whitelist/tray-first constraints unchanged.
- PASS: low/high animation budgets map to distinct intensity classes and duration scaling.
- PASS: focus/context chill clamps motion and applies calm posture.
- PARTIAL (needs interactive desktop runtime): fullscreen + meeting host + heavy typing triggers validated in code/tests but not observed manually in this headless run.

### Species + Cuteness
- PASS: species switching supports penguin/cat/corgi/axolotl and persists.
- PASS: species idle behavior now has profile-driven distinctions with clamp protection.
- PASS: validator includes remediation details and copyable failure report.
- PARTIAL (needs visual review): evolution silhouette/cuteness transitions require live visual sign-off in desktop runtime.

### Accessory Micro-Behaviors
- PASS: shop cards display accessory behavior hints.
- PASS: passive accessories allowed during chill; active accessories clamped in chill/low budget via composer rules.
- PASS: snack accessories animate only when motion level allows.

### Reliability + Recovery
- PASS: backup/import/reset/diagnostics commands unchanged and previously covered.
- PASS: clipboard fallback now truncates oversized payloads (new test coverage).
- PASS: species/settings persistence behavior unchanged and regression suite green.

## Open Manual Follow-Up (Release Candidate)
1. Run a visual desktop pass for fullscreen/meeting/heavy-typing chill transitions.
2. Run a visual evolution/cuteness pass against `docs/evolution-validation-checklist.md`.

No blocking issues found for merge; follow-up items are visual sign-off tasks for release gating.
